#Espresso Block

The iframe plugin used by [Espresso Grid](http://github.com/EspressoLogicCafe/espresso-grid.git), built with jQuery, Underscore, Twitter Bootstrap, AngularJS, ng-grid, and Espresso Transit.

This library is available to developers for customization, though the expectation is most interactions and configurations can be passed in using Espresso Grid, as [documented here](http://docs.espressologic.com/espresso-grid).
